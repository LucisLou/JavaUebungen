# Skill Diary - Java

## Week 1

In week 1 I managed to finish the tasks for "Introduction to Java", the competence check of Week 1, and the Bingo task of the second week.
Following java programs have been created:

* ![Folder: Tasks of Day 2](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/Uebung2)
* ![Folder: Tasks of Day 3](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/Uebung3)

* ![Java File: Bingo](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/blob/main/src/Uebung4/Bingo.java)

#### What I've learned that was new to me

I learned the formatted print printf, the new switch, and the try-catch statements.



## Week 2

In the second week I learned the concept of sorting algorithms and started the 3rd week of Java, learning how to use methods more in-depth than I already did.

Most notable for me at the start of the week was Divide and Conquer with mergeSort, which I spent an entire day researching and implementing myself:

After completing the competence check for Methods, I continued to work on the tasks for data structures:

Finally, I started working on the tasks for unit testing, creating a Tic Tac Toe game against the PC (no AI, PC move is random) and started using JUnit Jupiter for testing programs.

#### What I've learned that was new to me

I learned how to implement sorting algorithms and how to test programs properly via unit testing.
