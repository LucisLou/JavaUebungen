# Skill Diary - Java

## Week 1

In week 1 I managed to finish the tasks for "Introduction to Java", the competence check of Week 1, and the Bingo task of the second week.
Following java programs have been created:


* ![Folder: Tasks of Day 1](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/Uebung1) 
* ![Folder: Tasks of Day 2](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/Uebung2)
* ![Folder: Tasks of Day 3](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/Uebung3)
* ![Java File: Competence check Week 1 - Leet speak](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/blob/main/src/Kompetenz/Leetspeak.java)
* ![Java File: Bingo](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/blob/main/src/Uebung4/Bingo.java)

#### What I've learned that was new to me

I learned the formatted print printf, the new switch, and the try-catch statements.



## Week 2

In the second week I learned the concept of sorting algorithms and started the 3rd week of Java, learning how to use methods more in-depth than I already did.

Most notable for me at the start of the week was Divide and Conquer with mergeSort, which I spent an entire day researching and implementing myself:

After completing the competence check for Methods, I continued to work on the tasks for data structures:

* ![Folder: Tasks of Data Structures](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/Uebung7)

Finally, I started working on the tasks for unit testing, creating a Tic Tac Toe game against the PC (no AI, PC move is random) and started using JUnit Jupiter for testing programs.

#### What I've learned that was new to me

I learned how to implement sorting algorithms and how to test programs properly via unit testing.

## Week 3 

In the third week I started learning about Object-Oriented Programming.

As I only had 2 1/2 days to work on the competence due to taking 2 days off for my move, I spent the entirety of my time to the doubly linked list of OOP1.

* ![Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/blob/main/src/OOP1/DLL.java)

#### What I've learned that was new to me

I learned the basics of OOP, how to generate toString() and equals() with IntelliJ.


## Week 4

In the fourth week I continued with OOP, doing the tasks of OOP2. After finishing those tasks I continued teaching myself inheritance, exceptions, and file IO.

* ![Tasks of OOP2 - Part 2 - Photography](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/OOP2Photography)
* ![Task of Exceptions](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/Exceptions)
* ![Task of File IO - UserManagement](https://github.com/LucisLou/JavaUebungen/tree/main/src/UserManagementFile)

##### What I've learned that is new to me

I had never worked with external files before, so I learned a lot about how to read files in different way and how to write/overwrite them.
I also learned about creating my own exceptions and throwing them in my programs.
Along with file IO, I learned how to better make new String with StringBuilder.
