# Skill Diary - Java

## Week 1

In week 1 I managed to finish the tasks for "Introduction to Java", the competence check of Week 1, and the Bingo task of the second week.
Following java programs have been created:

#### What I've learned that was new to me

I learned the formatted print printf, the new switch, and the try-catch statements.

## Week 2

In the second week I learned all sorting algorithms and started the 3rd week of Java, learning how to use methods.

Most notable for me so far is Divide and Conquer with mergeSort, which I spent all day researching and implementing myself.
